# Challenge
Hello,

This is our challenge for potential new developer team members. The code is for a simple real-time TODO app. The challenge here is to fix some bugs, make some improvements and submit your code for evaluation by our team.

When you're finished, you should have a real-time TODO app that two or more people could use to share TODO's with one another. 

## Notes
- When we make, complete or delete a TODO item, it should show up the same way on all clients. To test this, we recommend having two browser windows open (one in-cognito and one not).
- It's not a race, but we expect this to be <= a couple of days work.
- This should be fun! If you're stuck on a bug or something needs clarification you can [email Alaa](mailto:a.jarad@lit-co.net?subject=TODO%20App%20JS%20Challenge%20Clarification) for help.

##  Your Quest

### Compulsory
- [X] Fix all the bugs
- [X] Add a feature that allows users to complete tasks
- [X] Add a feature that allows users to delete tasks
- [X] Add a feature that allows the completion of all tasks
- [X] Add a feature that allows the deletion of all tasks

### Extra
- [ ] Add caching to the client app so that when we lose our connection we can still see our TODO's
- [X] Make a design change to improve the user experience

## Set Up
This is a Node app so you'll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet. you can refere to [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install NodeJs (and npm), afterwards you can setup the project and start the server via:

```sh
npm install
node server
```

Now open `index.html` in your browser. Things won't work at first, but once the server is running, you should see your TODO's under the input.

## Done?
Great job! When you're all finished, submit your code and we'll review it.

## Submission
- The zip file should be named {yourname}.zip, and should itself contain the `todo_app` project folder with your submission.
- The zip file **SHOULD NOT INCLUDE** the `node_modules` folder nor the `package-lock.json` file.
- Send the zip file by email to [Alaa](mailto:a.jarad@lit-co.net?subject=TODO%20App%20JS%20Challenge%20Submission)
