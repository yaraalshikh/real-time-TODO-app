<h1 id="challenge">Challenge</h1>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is our challenge for potential new developer team members. The code is for a simple real-time TODO app. The challenge here is to fix some bugs, make some improvements and submit your code for evaluation by our team.</p>
<p>When you&#39;re finished, you should have a real-time TODO app that two or more people could use to share TODO&#39;s with one another. </p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When we make, complete or delete a TODO item, it should show up the same way on all clients. To test this, we recommend having two browser windows open (one in-cognito and one not).</li>
    <li>It&#39;s not a race, but we expect this to be &lt;= a couple of days work.</li>
    <li>This should be fun! If you&#39;re stuck on a bug or something needs clarification you can <a href="mailto:a.jarad@lit-co.net?subject=TODO%20App%20JS%20Challenge%20Clarification">email Alaa</a> for help.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compulsory">Compulsory</h3>

        <h3 id="extra">Extra</h3>
    </li>
    <li>[] Add caching to the client app so that when we lose our connection we can still see our TODO&#39;s</li>
    <li>[] Make a design change to improve the user experience</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
<p>This is a Node app so you&#39;ll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet. you can refere to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJs</a> to download and install NodeJs (and npm), afterwards you can setup the project and start the server via:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">npm install
<span class="hljs-keyword">node</span> <span class="hljs-title">server</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now open <code>index.html</code> in your browser. Things won&#39;t work at first, but once the server is running, you should see your TODO&#39;s under the input.</p>
<h2 id="done-">Done?</h2>
<p>Great job! When you&#39;re all finished, submit your code and we&#39;ll review it.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The zip file should be named {yourname}.zip, and should itself contain the <code>todo_app</code> project folder with your submission.</li>
    <li>The zip file <strong>SHOULD NOT INCLUDE</strong> the <code>node_modules</code> folder nor the <code>package-lock.json</code> file.</li>
    <li>Send the zip file by email to <a href="mailto:a.jarad@lit-co.net?subject=TODO%20App%20JS%20Challenge%20Submission">Alaa</a></li>
